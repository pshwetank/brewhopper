      <description>Digital networks were built for the purpose of sharing computing resources by people who were themselves sharing resources, technologies, and credit in order to create it.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They are incredibly beautiful, aren&amp;rsquo;t Them? Well, of course They Are!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this summary by hand, you can do it too in the &lt;code&gt;content/posts/&amp;lt;post-name&amp;gt;/index.md&lt;/code&gt; file! But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, if you don&amp;rsquo;t write a summary yourself, the theme will grab it automagically from the content of the post! And it will include it in SEO too!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The summary on this page was left empty, so it was grabbed from the first content the theme can find on the page, which is what you are reading right now!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;A wreathèd garland of deservèd praise,&#xA;Of praise deservèd, unto Thee I give,&#xA;I give to Thee, who knowest all my ways,&#xA;My crooked winding ways, wherein I live,—&#xA;Wherein I die, not live ; for life is straight,&#xA;Straight as a line, and ever tends to Thee,&#xA;To Thee, who art more far above deceit,&#xA;Than deceit seems above simplicity…&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By George Herbert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
